ML program is a sequence of bindings. Step 1: type checking; Step 2: evaluation.  
In ML, each binding adds first to static environment for type checking, and then to dynamic environment for evaluation.  
ML supports tuples by allowing any number of parts. And it can be nested however you want, like (7, (true, 9)) with type of (int * (bool * int)).  
ML supports list, with hd(return first element) and tl(return all elements excepet first one) as arguments.  
Functions that make and use lists are almost always recursive because a list has an unknown length.  
A let-expression lets us have local variables.  
logical and: andalso; logical or: orelse; logical negation: not; logical equal: =; logical not equal: <>.  



# ML variable bindings and expressions  
- 1.static environment: type-checking
- 2.dynamic environment: value bindings  

# Rules for expressions  
right question to ask in a new language:  
- 1.What is the syntax?
- 2.What are the type-checking rules?
- 3.What are the evaluation rules?  
In short: syntax, valid type and evaluation  
all values are expressions, but not all expressions are values.  

# REPL and Errors
REPL: read-eval-print-loop  
~5 means -5, and minus sign cannot be assigned in the first place.  

# shadowing  
What matters is the value of a variable rather than how the result is created.  

# functions informally  
type-checking of fuctions: pow = fn : int * int -> int  

# functions formally  
a function is already a value, default as 0.  

# pairs and other tuples  
#1 e and #2 e represent the first and second piece in a pair.  
```  
val x = (3,(4,(5,6)));
val y = (#2x,(#1x,#2(#2x)));
val ans = (#2y,4);

analysis:  
val y = ((4,(5,6)), (3,(5,6)))
val ans = ((3,(5,6)),4)
```  

# introducing lists  
val x = [7,8,9];  
5::6::x;  -- "::" pronounces as cons on 
result is [5,6,7,8,9]  
null e, where e is a list, can test whether e is empty. If e is empty, null e is true, else false.  
hd e, means the first piece in e.  
tl e, means the rest pieces of e except the first piece.  

# list functions  
recursion methods are widely applied in the lectures.
```sml
fun sum_list(xs : int list) = 
	if null xs
	then 0
	else hd(xs) + sum_list(tl(xs))

fun countdown(x : int) = 
	if x=0
	then []
	else x :: countdown(x-1)

fun append(xs : int list, ys: int list) = 
	if null xs
	then ys
	else hd(xs) :: append(tl(xs), ys)
```


# let expressions  
let expressions bring in scope conception, enabling local variables.  

# nested functions
define functions inside function as private functions.  

# let and efficiency  
watch out for recursion.  

# options
t option is a type for any type t  
None has type 'a option  
SOME e has type t option if e has type t  
isSome has type 'a option -> bool  
valOf has type 'a option -> 'a 

# Booleans and comparisons  
e1 andalso e2 means  
```
if e1
then e2
else false
```  
e1 orelse e2 means  
```
if e1
then true
else e2
```  
not e1 means   
```
if e1
then false
else true
```  
comparisons: = <> > < >= <=  
= <> requires "equality type" (real is not equality type)
